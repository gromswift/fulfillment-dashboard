# Fulfillment Dashboard

An interactive web application built with React 18, Next.js, and shadcn/ui for visualizing product inventory data in fulfillment centers. Users can upload CSV or XLSX files, parse and process data on the client side, and display it through dynamic tables and interactive charts. Key metrics are calculated and presented to provide valuable insights into inventory status.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
